.SYNOPSIS
    Hardens and remediates the Lenovo TPQM folder by killing related processes,
    removing old files, and reapplying secure permissions.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script is designed to remove, rebuild, and harden the Lenovo TPQM folder
    (C:\Program Files (x86)\Lenovo\TPQM). It stops related processes and services,
    attempts uninstallation if applicable, deletes and recreates the folder,
    and applies restrictive ACLs to prevent SYSTEM from writing to it.
    
    Intended to run under SYSTEM context (e.g., via Intune remediation or scheduled task).
    All activity is logged to C:\ProgramData\IntuneLogs\TPQM_Remediation.log.

.PARAMETER None
    The script takes no parameters.
