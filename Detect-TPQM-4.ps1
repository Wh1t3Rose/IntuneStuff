.SYNOPSIS
    Detects the presence of the Lenovo TPQM Assistant executable.

.DESCRIPTION
    This detection script checks whether the Lenovo TPQM Assistant executable 
    (`TPQMAssistant.exe`) exists at the expected installation path:
    `C:\Program Files (x86)\Lenovo\TPQM\Assistant\TPQMAssistant.exe`.

    It returns exit code `1` if the file is found (non-compliant), and `0` if not found (compliant).
    This is commonly used in Intune detection and remediation workflows to determine 
    whether TPQM needs removal or hardening.

.PARAMETER None
    The script takes no parameters.
